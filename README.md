# Sage Multiplex Image Interactors
3 Nov. 2020

Provides Jupyter notebooks that are aimed at providing interactive visualization of multiplex images themsevles and
analysis results on those images.

This notebook is meant to be run in a Docker container by mounting your data directory - data directory contains your
images, masks, and data csv files. Since all the paths are configured in a configs.py file it is possible to run the 
notebooks outside of a Docker container so long as you configure the paths appropriately.

To run with a Docker container use the following command which allows you to port-forward the Jupyter notebook port 
locally and to mount your data dir which should be mount to /data in the Docker container.

```docker run -it --rm -p####:8888 -v <data_dir>:/data jvizcar/sage_multiplex_interactors:latest```

Make sure to fill #### with the local port you want to port-forward to - the token password will be displayed in the 
terminal, copy paste this to access the notebook. <data_dir> should be the absolute path to your directory containing
all the images, image dirs, masks, and csv files.
